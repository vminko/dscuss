Dscuss - a P2P network for public discussions
=============================================

_The moderators are dead! Long live the moderators!_


Abstract
--------

Traditional systems for public discussion (like Internet forums) do not provide
equal rights to all users. Owners of the resource and moderators always possess
extended rights. Sometimes these rights can be abused, which eventually can
split the community of the resource and lead to its degeneration. As a solution
to this problem we present Dscuss. Itâ€™s a peer-to-peer network for public
discussions, which provides equal rights to all members of the community.


The idea of the project
-----------------------

The purpose of Dscuss is quite similar to the [Internet forums][forum_wiki], but
there is one fundamental difference -- social equality of all members involved
(i.e no owners, no moderators, etc). See [Classification][cls] for details.

This leads to the following key features, which will be provided by Dscuss:

* _Decentralization_. All the information will be stored on the users' machines.
* _Personal moderation_. Every user will be able to manage her own copy of data
  and may share her management operations (edit message, remove message, ban
  user and so on) with others, who would like to accept them.

Besides that, Dscuss is designed to provide the following features:

* _Data authenticity_
* _Data integrity_
* _Data availability_
* _SPAM resistance_ 
* _Flood resistance_

Dscuss is not intended to provide anonymity. However, this can probably be
achieved using anonymizers like [Tor][tor_home]

Progress of development
-----------------------

The current stable version is proof-of-work. It has the following features:

* Command-line interface.
* Basic security based on ECDSA.
* Persistent storage for entities.
* Basic networking (TCP only).
* Registration (via proof-of-work).
* Bootstrapping (via list of rendezvous nodes).
* Peer handshaking.
* Publishing a message.
* Listing a category.
* Subscription to categories (via editing a text file).
* Threading (replying to messages).
* Operations on messages and users.

The version 0.1 is under development. The following features are already
implemented:

* Database synchronization with other peers.
* Improved connectivity (bootstrapping via DHT).
* Web interface.
* Improved security (flood resistance).

The following additional features are planned for version 0.1:

* Improved security (SPAM resistance).


Dependencies
------------

Dscuss is written in Go and currently has the following dependencies:

* [github.com/abiosoft/ishell][ish_home] - Library for creating interactive cli applications.
* [github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3][gosql] - [SQLite][sql_home] driver.
* [golang.org/x/crypto/scrypt][scrpt] - Library implementing "Stronger Key
  Derivation via Sequential Memory-Hard Functions".
* [github.com/nictuku/dht][dht] - Kademlia/Bittorrent DHT library that
  implements BEP 5.

Initially Dscuss was supposed to be built on top of the [GNUnet][gn_home]
framework, but later it was considered not suitable for the purposes of Dscuss.
